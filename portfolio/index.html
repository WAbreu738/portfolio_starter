            <h1 class="about-me">About Me<sup class="sub">|02</sup></h1>
            <img class="headshot" src="./assets/wesley.jpg">
            <p class="about-me-pg"> I am fueled by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a deep passion for learning.
                Although I may be relatively new to the field of web design, it is a career path that resonates with me
                on a profound level, igniting a fire within me to continuously evolve and grow. Armed with skills in
                HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I am eager to embark on this journey of exploration and mastery, pushing the
                boundaries of what I can create and achieve in the digital realm.</p>

            <p class="about-me-pg"> Beyond the world of coding and design, I find joy in embracing life's adventures and
                pursuing adrenaline-fueled thrills. Whether it's diving headfirst into a new video game, exploring the
                great outdoors with my dog Yogi by my side, or seeking out the next heart-pounding escapade like
                skydiving, flying a plane, rock climbing, paintballing, or scuba diving, I thrive on the excitement of
                new experiences. Balancing the exhilaration of exploration with the discipline of honing my craft, I
                approach both work and play with a relentless spirit of curiosity and a determination to seize every
                opportunity for growth and discovery.</p>

            <p class="about-me-pg"> In addition to my passion for learning and adventure, I thrive in collaborative
                environments and relish the opportunity to work alongside diverse teams. Meeting new people and
                exchanging ideas not only fuels my creativity but also enriches my perspective, driving me to
                continuously improve and innovate. If you're ready to embark on an exciting journey of digital creation,
                whether it's building a website, developing an app, or tackling a new project together, I'd love to hear
                from you. Let's connect and bring your vision to life!</p>
